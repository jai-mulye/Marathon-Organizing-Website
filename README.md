# marathon-organizing-website

This is a Marathon Organizing Website made only with HTML and CSS.
No Flexbox or Bootstrap or Javascript was used for making this website.
Content of the website is Static and has no BackEnd. (Just a FrontEnd Template)

The focus of this project wasn't on creating a visually pleasing and responsive website but to test out the skills for making a website solely based on HTML and Basic CSS. This website might not seem visually pleasing when changing the viewing size.

The concept of website starts with a landing page, followed by a registration form with basic validation (required tag), next is an announcement page providing information of the past and upcoming event alerts and a photo gallery containing photos from the organized events. 

The theme was based around using (white, black and tomato) colors. The theme also included the use of black and white background images and the use of transparency to define various sections. Only the landing page was made colorful.
